Requirements:
Use the MVC Pattern to write the app
1:30pm to 5:30pm, 4 hours

submit a repo link at around 5:20pm est

we care about the last commit
(if you committed your code around 4pm, but forgot and submitted at 5:35, that's fine)

make sure your first commit is before the deadline

if you want to improve after deadline, you're welcome to do so

use a json server as the database



Guides:

Javascript:
